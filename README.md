# Simon-Game
This is a Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves a sequence of colors and sounds that the player must repeat. With each correct repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging. The game ends when the player makes a mistake, and they are asked to restart by pressing any key.
## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the game.
- `style.css`: The styling for the game.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript code for game logic.
- `sounds/`: Folder containing sound files for each color and the 'wrong' sound.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to play the game.
3. Make sure to keep the sound files in the `sounds/` directory for the game to work properly.
