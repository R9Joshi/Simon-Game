# Simon-Game
This is a Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves a sequence of colors and sounds that the player must repeat. With each correct repetition, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging. The game ends when the player makes a mistake, and they are asked to restart by pressing any key.
